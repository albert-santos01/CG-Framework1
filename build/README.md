You choose the task with the numbers taskbar

1) It will draw the image under gouraud shading.

2) It will draw the image under phong shading.

3) It will draw the image under phong shading and with more than one light, which can be *added* using the *tab* key, initially 
there are 3 lights. Their *position* may also be changed by pressing the *L* key *along* with the *letter* for each light 
(the first light will be light A, the second will be light B, etc… until the 7th, which will be light G) to select a light and 
change its *position* using the wasd and zx* keys (w and s for the y axis, a and d for the x axis and z and x for the z axis).

4) In addition to many lights, we will also be able to add many more objects with the key *PLUS (+)*. They will be added to fill 
3 rows of 5 columns of objects. If more were to be added, we simply put them further away.


In all four parts, you can *orbit around the center using the *arrows* and the *n* and *m* keys (up and down for the yz axis, right 
and left for the xz axis and n and m for the xy axis). You can also change the *center position with the ijkl* keys. 

Additionally, we have also added a functionality that *resets the camera coordinates, fov and the center coordinates* pressing the 
*R* key. This does have its limitations, however, because if you rotate the object with the SPACE key, the reset *won’t* set its 
angle of rotation to its initial angle.

Last but not least, the color of the background does not affect the scene as an ambient light, but it can be set if it is desired.
